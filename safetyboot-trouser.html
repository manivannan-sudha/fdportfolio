            <h1>Design Story</h1>
            <p>
                During the 6th semester, we learnt about the making of safety boots, and I chose
to do this as the final product for final assessment because it needed a pinch of
extra efforts comparatively. And when I started thinking about the design, I
wanted to add some element to it which matches to the garment as well, so I have
added the camouflage printed canvas to the footwear which was also used in the
garment.

The height of the boots can be reduced by folding it outwards and fastening it
with the snap buttons.
Regarding the garment, cargo pockets of camouflage printed canvas is added
as the element of design to the jacket. For the trouser, it is constructed using
panels of patterns put together.
